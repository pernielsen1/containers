All children stops now !! 
make retry i "grand mama" if option is retry... - and a retry count..... 
create test runner for whole stream... start up all wait for "all ready"


Ideas
make command that changes the timeout.. good in testing and ensures we take the timeout from the same place .. 
should work has dict a return data ? for the test case ?... hmmm 



# ./sendmsg.sh 8077 test to_middle 1
Stop middle (8078)
# ./sendmsg.sh 8078 stop
Stop client (8077)
# ./sendmsg.sh 8077 stop



# ./sendmsg.sh 8076 ready
Extend the work function - remove the send. / test

Documentation ?
grandmama start commands on done statuses 
should we move use the runcommand from sendmsg in console ??? 

SSL - not a lot needed ... Install SSL also... plus as a parameter on all - start with command app

Refactor: 
send_request(port, "work", queue_name, iso_msg_raw, num_messages)
remove add_item_create dict from crypto_filters - now found in isu8583_utils - should be encapsulated there
OBS is used for ARQC and ARPC... 
utils as own or keep it ?


cleanup in Crypto Filters.
rename 47 to private field.
rename to FilterSim.... 

console to send waiting test case - currently send as work by command below ? 
./sendmsg.sh 8077 test to_middle "test_case_1" 1


Clean up in console app 
optimised debug messages.. (len) + hex 



clean up move console & sendmsg to config dir - maybe not a good idea... 
Document the whole flow it's about time again
