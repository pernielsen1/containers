ToDo: 
put measurement in MessageObject and adapt in Queue - after work.

put host name in the connections...  currenty just hardcoded localhost


Big Mama decision to stopp - if no activity..
make a "debug out" - queue.
look a debug messages - what should be there and not.  could be a logger worker...


Nice to have:
cast a message to messagestring perhaps inside the worker to write  received result maybe with isinstance ? 
Not sure this would work... current thread does.
command handler could be class in command_thread ?

clean debug log - and try it again.
get different times from config dict-

logger thread became variation of worker... document in client.json

Instructions:
./stopall.sh
./sendmsg.sh 8077 send to_middle "Merry go round"



Done:
Echo filter in backend - add " and return" to the message
upper filter applied before sending to backend
