ingen timeout command men config parmen plus use everyvere
Implement the timeout command... needed in config files plus a command to change it.
Make a test script setting upp all 
make retry i "grand mama"... 
Try except in the run commands... 
if except then set the "stop" and exit.. will kill all others in the stream..  - then app can be restarted.


Ideas
make command that changes the timeout.. good in testing and ensures we take the timeout from the same place .. 
should work has dict a return data ? for the test case ?... hmmm 


create test runner for whole stream... start up all wait for "all ready"

# ./sendmsg.sh 8076 stop
# ./sendmsg.sh 8076 ready
Extend the work function - remove the send. / test

Documentation ?
grandmama start commands on done statuses 

SSL - not a lot needed ... Install SSL also... plus as a parameter on all - start with command app

Refactor: 
send_request(port, "work", queue_name, iso_msg_raw, num_messages)
remove add_item_create dict from crypto_filters - now found in isu8583_utils - should be encapsulated there
OBS is used for ARQC and ARPC... 
utils as own or keep it ?


cleanup in Crypto Filters.
rename 47 to private field.
rename to FilterSim.... 

console to send waiting test case - currently send as work by command below ? 
./sendmsg.sh 8077 test to_middle "test_case_1" 1


Clean up in console app 
optimised debug messages.. (len) + hex 



clean up move console & sendmsg to config dir - maybe not a good idea... 
Document the whole flow it's about time again
