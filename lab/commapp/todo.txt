ToDo: 
Put name of server (middle . bakcend ) etc in response after stopping.
put measurement in MessageObject and adapt in Queue - after work.
implment logger queue... (only absorb or dual ? ) log_to_queue --- 

better to queeu - enclose in brackets... and there is send to queue who doesn't name it
move init routers & workers to the application instead of in main  
Big Mama decision to stopp - if no activity..
make a "debug out" - queue.
look a debug messages - what should be there and not.

Nice to have:
cast a message to messagestring
Understand why is app globally available  ?


Instructions:
./stopall.sh
./sendmsg.sh 8077 send to_middle "Merry go round"



Done:
Echo filter in backend - add " and return" to the message
upper filter applied before sending to backend
