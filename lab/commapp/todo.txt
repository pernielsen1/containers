ToDo: 
# time.strftime(format[, t])Â¶

measurements done for workers now it's all about presentation now.
put host name in the connections...  currenty just hardcoded localhost
reset all measurements..

Big Mama decision to stopp - if no activity..


Nice to have:
cast a message to messagestring perhaps inside the worker to write  received result maybe with isinstance ? 
Not sure this would work... current thread does.
command handler could be class in command_thread ?

clean debug log - and try it again.
get different times from config dict-

logger thread became variation of worker... document in client.json

Instructions:
./stopall.sh
./sendmsg.sh 8077 send to_middle "Merry go round"



Done:
Echo filter in backend - add " and return" to the message
upper filter applied before sending to backend
