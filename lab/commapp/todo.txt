ToDo: 
Create the tests (or test directory ?)

the work command should have a "wait for response and then time out " - 
can we wait in another thread and keep it alive command alive still ?  multiple sockets ? hmm 
rename 47 to private field.

console to send waiting test case - currently send as work by command below ? 
./sendmsg.sh 8077 test to_middle "test_case_1" 1


Debatable: the text carries the inbound field 47 ... should it do this ?



console seconds does not count up... 

I command skal vi have allowed commands and functions in dict-

So it is:
Send work - wait for response in Filter... 
work will do the run of the filter... 
Then response is coming into the client and handled in log result work - which applies the response filter... 


Sen kommer svaret of ett filter samlar upp waiy wakey


Clean up in console app 
time str move 0715 to 1916
allowed commands and function in a dict
optimised debug messages.. (len) + hex 
grandmama start commands on done statuses 
 

clean up comm app if possible ?
Documentation ?
Install SSL also... plus as a parameter on all - start with command app




clean up move console & sendmsg to config dir - maybe not a good idea... 
Listen still binds or does it now 20250615 ? 

Done:

./sendmsg.sh 8077 test to_middle "test_case_1" 1

Clean up...
Document the whole flow it's about time again

documentation
pandoc -i the_flow.md -o the_flow.html
create the drawing in ppt and get to the md.. 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial

Next steps:
Restart..
mama_stats... 
the web admin page.. manamgement console = own application. console.py

Ideas laterr... 
"convert dict to able html - shoud be possible... 
labe dict to table... html.. 


for i in *.md ; do echo "$i" && pandoc -s $i -o $i.html ; done

small things:
timeout på en put... ? - det var det som gick galt någing "consumed from_middle"
Error handling... refused connection .. what to do.. not fail on none..

https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/a-beginners-guide-to-ci-cd-and-automation-on-github/

Next bit thing: 
lad data som sendes indeholde en json struktur... og om den gör så lägger vi 
"producer_ns"
"echo_ns ind". 
" nu har vi en loop situation som vi kan provocera - bara change "echo_in" to "no_echo_in" i worker så timer den ud... 

Men hvorfor for Mama inte stoppet den tråd ?  eller skal man bara lave timeout på put and then die ? 


Lav en variation som ere en "web server" - så vi kan köre helt isoleret uden fastapi.. 


A msg_id and notification so "send" can throttle..
can we even emulate the crypto backend here ?? .. why not.

Data and message... 
Json (msg_id + data) and waitfilter.... hmm 
Command object gets "send message 100000 times"... 
Starts new thread with this task (not under mama ? well not initially)
SEt max size on queue instead... 

Constructor for a FIFO queue. maxsize is an integer that sets the upperbound limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue. Insertion will block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed. If maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.

(Message id not nescessary to control speed... 

Long term:
Big Mama decision to stopp - if no activity..


Nice to have:
cast a message to messagestring perhaps inside the worker to write  received result maybe with isinstance ? 
Not sure this would work... current thread does.
command handler could be class in command_thread ?

clean debug log - and try it again.
get different times from config dict-

logger thread became variation of worker... document in client.json

Instructions:
./stopall.sh
./sendmsg.sh 8077 send to_middle "Merry go round" 5
./sendmsg.sh 8078 stat 
./sendmsg.sh 8078 reset 

error handling iso decode.. 
Done:
Echo filter in backend - add " and return" to the message
upper filter applied before sending to backend
