<p>commapp can drive several types of communication applications built
up around sockets, queues, filters, workers and a simple http server.
The main example consists of<br />
<strong>client</strong> - an application which will send a iso8583 0100
message to<br />
<strong>middle</strong> - and application receiving on socket (from
client) the iso8583 request, parses it, jump out to crypto server to
complete an arqc and finally send the request to backend.<br />
<strong>backend</strong> - a simple backend simulator who will simply
see if we should approve and creates a 0110 answer which goes back
to<br />
<strong>middle</strong> - who will parse the request, jump out to crypto
server to calculate an arpc and send the result to 
<strong>client</strong> - who will log the result.<br />
</p>
<p>socket connections between client, middle and backend are kept open.
a TCP message starts with a length field i.e. 4 bytes of ascii or 4
binary bytes. all configuration are kept in the config directory and
will have same name as applications above i.e. middle.json is the config
file for the middle processes.</p>
<p>supporting cast <strong>testmsg</strong> who can initiate a test by
connecting to the http server for <strong>client</strong>
<strong>crypto_server</strong> receives json request and performs arqc
or arpc calculation</p>
<h2 id="client">client</h2>
<p>client starts by connecting to <strong>middle</strong> on a
socket</p>
<p> All commaps can be started by the "grand_mama"</p>
