ToDo:
Monitor queue - depth in redis should be possible from test runner ?  display a queue ? 

make a winhome_onedrive /mnt/c/perni/winhome_onedrive
get the stop to works..  with the threads
move the establish sockets to receive forever... i.e. to the thread.. 

------------------------------------------------
send command to all queues async*  (list)  
do it to real application ? .. parse iso etc ??? 
locust - can be done with send_and_wait now... 


Really nice to have:
return stats from server to client requesting it.

Draw the application

Logging: 
check the the setlogger with name & logger ? 
add name in the logger function.
check failed tests on fastapi... 


Qeuue - workers more long term... 
establish a queue to queue which is only one worker  - that's how you would want it.

Locust... take it in lab first ...  incl redis in lab "pip install locust
https://manojsingh0302.medium.com/load-test-redis-with-locust-io-in-python-b59d38724054

make the server & client to just workers... then we can harmonize.. (maybe.. - still need to share the socket.. )
